CS61B Lab #12

In this lab, we'd like to make sure you are started on the project.
If you have already started, make sure your files are up to date with
our skeleton.

The homework this week asks you to get some minimal amount of the
graph package working.  Let's get started on that now. Copy
the files for the 'graph' package in project 3 (there is a copy of
that directory in the hw10 files as well) into your working directory
and commit them.

Make sure you understand the contents of this package.  Ask your TA if
anything is unclear.  Choose a representation for keeping track of the
vertices and edges of a graph (you can modify Basic, DirectedGraph,
UndirectedGraph, Vertex, and Edge).  For hw10, you can get away with
implementing only a little: you'll probably want at least

* The constructors.
* The add methods in Basic and DirectedGraph for adding vertices and edges.
* The edges(), edges(v), and vertices() methods in Basic and DirectedGraph for
  iterating over vertices or edges.

... and possibly more.  Work on implementing these.

While you are doing so, start adding JUnit tests for the methods you
are writing.

To be efficient, try to come up with sufficient implementations for the
purposes of project 3, so that you can use the same code there as
well.  Be sure, however, that you transfer anything you do for HW10 to
your repository for proj3, and then stop developing the HW10 version,
or there will be mass confusion eventually!
