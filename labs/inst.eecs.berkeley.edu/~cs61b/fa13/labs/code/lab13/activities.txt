CS61B Lab #13

1. Project Checkpoint
---------------------

We expect you're likely to be working feverishly on the project this week, so
the TAs are here to help you.  In particular, they will be trying to get a
sense of how far each of you has gotten and what problems you are 
encountering, as for Projects #1 and #2.
