CS61B Lab #4

Please finish this lab by Friday, preferably during the lab period.  It is due
at midnight Friday.

1. Quizzes
----------

Do the indicated quizzes given on the lab index page.  The quizzes
are the only things that needed to be handed in; you don't need to 
submit anything for lab4 via svn.


2. Project Work
---------------

We expect you're likely to be working feverishly on the project this week, so
the TAs are here to help you.
